# Yarn plugins

This repository contains various yarn plugins

## Experimental

The [publish-extra](./packages/publish-extra) plugin adds support to packaging and publishing arbitrary folders and files, instead of being limited to only packaging/publishing workspace folders.

## Very Experimental

The [bucket](./packages/bucket) plugin adds a new dependency range protocol called `bucket:`. This protocol makes it easy to align dependencies to a single version.

The [super-delux](./packages/super-delux) plugin adds a `yarn sdlx` command that creates portable standalone scripts from npm packages.
